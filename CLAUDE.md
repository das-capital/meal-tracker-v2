## What This App Is

A personal mobile-first PWA for tracking daily food intake, weight, and nutrition macros. The user interacts primarily through a chat interface — they type (or speak) what they ate and an AI (Gemini 2.5 Flash) parses it and logs the macros. The app is built for Indian + general food tracking.

**Deployed as a PWA** — runs in the browser, installable on phone, works offline for UI (API calls need internet).

## Database (IndexedDB)

**DB name:** `meal-tracker-db`
**Current version:** `4` — bump this number whenever you add/change a store

| Store | Key | Indexes | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `meals` | id (auto) | by-date | Logged meals |
| `settings` | key | — | User settings (key/value pairs) |
| `favourites` | id (auto) | by-name (unique) | Saved favourite meals |
| `weights` | id (auto) | by-date | Weight log entries |
| `recipes` | id (auto) | by-name (unique) | Custom recipes with ingredients |

**Critical rule:** Always add `if (!db.objectStoreNames.contains(...))` guard when creating stores in the `upgrade` callback — this is required because the upgrade runs for ALL version increments, not just the latest.

---

## Key Interfaces (db.ts)

```typescript
Meal            — logged meal with parsed macros array + totalCalories
Favourite       — saved meal shortcut (name + parsed macros)
WeightEntry     — date + weight (kg)
UserSettings    — apiKey, daily goals, portion unit sizes, profile (age/weight/height)
RecipeIngredient — name, weight(g), calories, protein, fat, carbs, fiber
Recipe          — name, ingredients[], totalWeight, total macros, createdAt
```

---

## AI Parser (ai-parser.ts)

All Gemini calls go through `callGemini(apiKey, prompt)` which hits:
`https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-2.5-flash:generateContent`

**Exported functions:**
- `processInput(text)` — main chat handler, returns `AIResponse` union type
- `parseIngredients(text)` — extracts ingredient list with macros for recipe builder
- `getMealSuggestion()` — suggests a meal based on remaining macros
- `getSmartObservations()` — weekly pattern analysis

**AIResponse types** that `processInput` can return:
`meal` | `chat` | `favourite_save` | `favourite_log` | `weight` | `height` | `age` | `recipe_log` | `error`

The system prompt injects: today's meals, daily totals, goals, portion sizes, and saved recipe names so Gemini has full context.

## Key Patterns & Conventions

- **Slide-up panels** (FavouritesPanel, RecipesPanel): use `AnimatePresence` + `motion.div` with `y: '100%'` → `y: 0`, spring transition `damping: 25, stiffness: 300`, backdrop at `z-[60]`, panel at `z-[70]`, `max-h-[85vh]`, `pb-20` to clear the bottom nav.
- **Chat messages** in MealInput are persisted to `localStorage` keyed by today's date — cleared automatically on a new day.
- **Recipe logging from panel** uses a `CustomEvent('recipe-log')` dispatched on `window` — MealInput listens for it via `useEffect`.
- **Confetti** on meal log: `canvas-confetti` shooting from both sides.
- **Dark theme** throughout: `bg-zinc-900` base, `bg-zinc-800` cards, `border-white/5` or `border-white/10` borders, `text-zinc-200` primary text.

## How to Run

```bash
cd "/c/Users/Pc/Documents/Vibe coding/meal-tracker"
npm run dev       # dev server
npm run build     # production build
```

The user provides their own Gemini API key in the Settings page of the app.
